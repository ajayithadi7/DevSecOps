# Day 1 ‚Äì Cloud Computing Fundamentals

Today marks the start of my AWS & DevOps learning journey. I focused on understanding Cloud Computing service and deployment models.

## üìù Notes

### What is Cloud Computing?
On demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet
Renting computing resources over the internet instead of owning and managing physical hardware. 
Examples include file storage (Google Drive), streaming (Netflix), and email (Gmail).

### Benefits
- Cost-effective: Pay only for what you use
- Scalable: Add/remove resources easily
- Accessible: Work from anywhere
- Reliable: High uptime with top providers

### Service Models
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** Raw infrastructure (e.g., AWS EC2, Azure VMs)
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** Managed platform to develop/deploy apps (e.g., AWS Elastic Beanstalk)
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Ready-to-use software (e.g., Gmail, Microsoft 365)

### Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud:** Shared infrastructure by providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- **Private Cloud:** Dedicated infrastructure for one org (on-prem or hosted)
- **Hybrid Cloud:** Combination of public + private for flexibility
- **Community Cloud:** Shared infrastructure for orgs with common needs (education, research)
