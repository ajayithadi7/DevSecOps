## Day 1: Introduction to AWS & DevOps Fundamentals

### Understanding Cloud Computing

- **Definition**: Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources via the internet, replacing the need to own physical hardware.
- **Everyday Examples**: Services like Google Drive, Netflix streaming, and Gmail rely on the cloud to function efficiently.
- **Advantages**:  
  - Cost-efficiency  
  - Rapid scaling capabilities  
  - Global reach and accessibility  
  - High reliability (though outages occasionally occur)

### Cloud Service Models

- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**
  - Provides virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networking)
  - Example: AWS EC2
  - User manages operating systems and applications

- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**
  - Delivers a pre-configured platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications
  - Example: AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  - Underlying infrastructure is managed by the provider

- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**
  - Delivers fully functional applications for end users
  - Example: Gmail, Zoom, Salesforce
  - No infrastructure or platform management required by the user

### Cloud Deployment Models

- **Public Cloud**
  - Shared infrastructure accessible to multiple organizations
  - Providers: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform

- **Private Cloud**
  - Dedicated infrastructure for one organization
  - Enhanced security and control, higher cost

- **Hybrid Cloud**
  - Integrates public and private cloud resources for increased flexibility

- **Community Cloud**
  - Infrastructure shared by organizations with common requirements (e.g., research institutions)

### Importance for AWS & DevOps

- Mastery of cloud concepts is foundational for leveraging AWS and adopting DevOps practices.
- Informed selection between service and deployment models enables organizations to optimize for security, cost, scalability, and performance as they build and operate technical solutions.
